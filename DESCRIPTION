Description: Assigns students to schools to minimize walking distance subject to
    space constraints at each school. Also allows users to create maps showing    
    student assignments. This package implements in R a C# program written by Dennis
    Fetterly for the Belmont Redwood Shores School District in Northern California.
    I thank Dennis for helpful conversations and for sharing his code. I also thank
    Sam Buttrey for showing me how to use lpSolve and for providing a    
    template for the assignStudents function.
